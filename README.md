# Used-Car-Prediction-Gradient-Boosting-Regression-Model
Kaggle Competition Used Car Prediction that includes test and train dataset. The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model fine-tuned on the Used Car Price Prediction Dataset dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original.

train.csv - the training dataset; refer to the original dataset link above for column descriptions
test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the value of the target Price

Goal/Objective: Predict the price of used vehicles.

Output: Predicted in Ascending order

First Choice Model: Linear Regression
